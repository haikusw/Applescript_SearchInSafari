# Search In Safari AppleScript

An AppleScript to search the *textual content* in all Safari tabs in all windows - *except windows minimized to the Dock*

# Installation

- I put the script file into ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari </br>  (note that you can put aliases to files here so you can download the repot to some logical place you keep repos or applescripts and then make an alias of to that file in the Safari Scripts folder location noted).

- Then I enable "Show Script menu in menu bar" in the `Script Editor > Preferences…`

Alternatively, or in addition, setup Alfred or similar with a hot key to invoke it.

# TODO:
- Put up a dialog if nothing is found (just does nothing currently)
- See if there's a way to include the minimized windows

# Notes
- Only tested on macOS 12.4 and Safari 15.5
